Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do. The computer doesn't care about your feelings, but the human does.

In programming, we often write code that works, but is it readable? Is it maintainable? These are questions every programmer should ask themselves.

Code is read more often than it is written. Write code for humans, not just for computers. Good code tells a story. Bad code is like a puzzle that nobody wants to solve.

The best programmers are not those who write the most complex code, but those who write simple, elegant solutions. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication in programming.

Remember: there are only two hard things in computer science - cache invalidation and naming things. And off-by-one errors. Wait, that's three things.

Programming languages come and go, but the principles of good programming remain the same. Learn principles, not just syntax. Master the fundamentals, and you can adapt to any language or framework.

Every bug you fix makes you a better programmer. Every mistake teaches you something new. Embrace the debugging process - it's where real learning happens.

Write tests. Write documentation. Write code that your future self will thank you for. Programming is not just about solving today's problems, but about creating solutions that last.
